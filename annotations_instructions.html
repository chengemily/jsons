  <h1>Overall goals</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Clean up and standardize player data (it is quite noisy as it is self-submitted)</li>
    <li>Track perception and understanding of signs by players</li>
    <li>Classify signs into index, icon, and symbol.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1>Navigation</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>One spreadsheet tab <N,N+1> = one pair of subjects with pair ID <N, N+1>.</li>
    <li>Player-submitted data (left = teacher, right = student): global observations about a task, sign drawing + meaning used in the task ("signaries").</li>
      <li>If tasks end before 44 (total # of tasks), it's because the pair withdrew at that time.</li>
  </ol>
      
      <h1>Instructions</h1>
      <h2>Data cleaning</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Problem:</b> players register multiple signs for the same sign. E.g. "TOUCH RED" and "TOUCH BLUE" should be absorbed into "TOUCH". <b>To do:</b> For each sign, enter a unique ID in the ID column, starting with 0 and incrementing with each new sign. When signs are changed, (they'll be marked "CHANGED"), assign the sign a new number.</li>
        <li> <b>Problem:</b> players don't register new or previously used signs but describe them in observations. <b>To do:</b> add a sign + its meaning (taking verbatim if possible). E.g. Signs: "TOUCH" + Meanings: "Go to each of the objects. I think the student understood quickly"</li>
      </ol>
<h2>Perception and Understanding</h2>
  <ol>
    <li> <b>To do:</b> Annotate each sign in "Score" column with 1, 2, or 3 using context clues from observations and signaries.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>1: Un-noticed by other player</li>
      <li>2: Noticed but not understood</li>
      <li>3: Noticed and understood</li>
     </ol>
    <li>Note: Sometimes players will un-understand or un-notice a sign. Just put the number independently of whether it was previously understood or noticed.</li>
  </ol>
      
      <h2>Indices, icons, and symbols</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> <b>Goal:</b> classify all signs into indices, icons, and symbols. This can be done once per sign when it's introduced.</li>
        <li> <b>To do:</b> Annotate each sign in "Cat" column with 1, 2, and/or 3 according to the rubric. If a sign meets multiple criteria, put multiple numbers ordered by salience. E.g. if it's mostly symbolic and also iconic, put "32".</li>
        <ol>
          <li> 1: Does the sign "point" to its meaning? ("index"). E.g. TOUCH</li>
          <li> 2: Does the sign physically look like its meaning? E.g. TRIANGLE, BACKWARDS ("icon")</li>
          <li> 3: Does the sign's shape have no obvious relationship to its meaning? (More likely when the meaning is abstract or when the sign is abstract). E.g. NO ("symbol") </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
